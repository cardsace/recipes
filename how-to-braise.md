# How to Braise
1. Braise cuts from the shoulder, leg, or rump, and those that contain a lot of connective tissue: chuck, shank, brisket, and oxtail.

1. Preheat your oven to 300 F.
1. Pat the meat dry with paper towels.
1. Trim off any excess fat.
1. Heat oil in a Dutch oven over high heat. When the oil is very hot, add the meat. 
1. Brown the meat for a minute or two on all sides. Remove the meat and set it aside.
1. Lower the heat to medium and add aromatic vegetables 
1. Saut√© for a few minutes or until the vegetables start to soften.
1. Deglaze the pan with a flavorful liquid, such as stock, broth, or wine.
1. Scrape off any roasted bits (called fond) from the bottom of the pan and bring the liquid to a simmer.
1. Return the meat to the pot along with an acidic ingredient like diced tomatoes or wine.  
1. The liquid should just barely cover the meat. You can now add other flavorings and seasonings, like whole peppercorns or bay leaves.
1. Bring the braising liquid back to a simmer, then cover the pan with a tight-fitting lid and transfer it to the 300 F oven.
1. Braise for 1 to 5 hours, depending on the size of the meat. Figure about an hour per pound.
1. Remove the pan from the oven. 
1. Make gravy from strained braising liquid and roux.

### Tips
* Depending on the size or the cut of meat, you might want to heat the oven to 275 F or even 250 F.
* If you are braising shanks, you can make a few vertical (parallel to the bone) cuts in the outer membrane so that the meat will not twist out of shape while it braises. 
* Oven braising is best because the meat is cooked with indirect heat. But if you do not have an oven-safe pot, you can braise on the stove top over low heat. Check periodically to make sure the liquid just simmering,not boiling.
* To cool and store braised meat, leave the meat in the braising liquid so that it does not dry out.
