# Raspberry Liqueur

|Ingredients | |
|-----:|----|
|24 oz| fresh or frozen raspberries
|3 &frac12; c.| vodka (100 proof)
|1 c.| sugar
## Directions
1. Pour raspberries into a large jar and cover with sugar. Pour vodka over all and close with lid.
2. Shake several times the first day until all of the sugar has dissolved.
3. Store in a cool, dark place for a minimum of one month (I recommend 6 weeks, longer is fine too). Shake every day or two.
4. When the liqueur is ready to be bottled, line a strainer with a couple of layers of cheesecloth, preferably butter muslin and place it over a large pot or bowl.
5. Pour the liquor over the cheesecloth slowly letting the liquid drain while the strainer catches the solids. Repeat if necessary.
