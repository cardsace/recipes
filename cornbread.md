***by AzArli***
## Ingredients
- 2 eggs
- 2 cups white cornmeal
- 2 cups buttermilk
- 1 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- $1/4$ cup bacon grease
- salt (most bacon grease provides plenty of saltiness)

## Directions
- Preheat oven to 425&deg;
- Put first 5 ingredients in mixing bowl.
- Mix with large spoon or whisk.
- Put bacon grease in well-seasoned 10-inch cst iron skillet of medium to high heat.
- Just as the bacon grease is about to start smoking, pour it into the other ingredients, stirring as you pour. Leave enough in the skillet to coat the bottom and sides.
- Pour the entire mixture into the skillet.
- Place skillet on middle rack of oven; bake until cornbread is springy in the middle, browned and pulling away from the skillet on the sides (about 15-20 minutes)
- Remove from the oven and invert skillet over serving plate. If cornbread does not drop easily, you may need to run an icing spatula around/under it so it come loose.
- Recipe halves well, just remember yu cannot cut the bacon grease by half because you still need to coat the skillet.
- Serve hot, with plenty of butter.
